- TODO: Properly Fix Erase Mechanism
	|need to get rid of the random draw call in the middle of the if statement that handles backspace

	|set a text font with the same characters as the actual text, color it the same as background, call this on every loop 		but don't change the text on backspace 
		-this calls two draw calls on every loop which is far less efficient
		-organizes the draw calls to only be at the bottom of the loop

- TODO: Deal with Arg conditions
	|change command to a vector so that it can hold arg conditions, that we only need to check the length of the vector to 		determine whether theres a arg command or not
	|the unicode should be checked for a space in which case it should push a new string into it such as "String::new()"
