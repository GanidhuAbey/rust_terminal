- TODO: Properly Fix Erase Mechanism
	|need to get rid of the random draw call in the middle of the if statement that handles backspace

	|set a text font with the same characters as the actual text, color it the same as background, call this on every loop 		but don't change the text on backspace 
		-this calls two draw calls on every loop which is far less efficient
		-organizes the draw calls to only be at the bottom of the loop
